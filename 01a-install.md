# Install software on your computer


### Install [git](http://git-scm.com/).

You have it installed if you can run `git --version` at the command
line and get output like `git version 2.13.5`.

Macbooks have git pre-installed.


### Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads).

Please install the **3.6 version** if possible.

There are two things you can verify to check your install.

First, from the command line, all of the following should start up
some kind of Python interpreter:

```bash
python3
ipython3
jupyter notebook
spyder
```

Second, inside any of those Python interpreters, you should be able to
do all of these without error:

```python
import numpy
import scipy
import matplotlib
import pandas
import statsmodels
import sklearn
```

### Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on Mac

### Q1. Python Version 2 or 3

**Course material for the bootcamp is compatible with Python versions 2.7 and 3.0. All HackerRank Python pre-work is configured for Python 3 only.  Therefore, Python 3 is the recommended version.**  

Did you install Python 2 or 3? Why?  

>> I installed Python 3. As someone who only started learning Python as of 2018, I did some research on where to start and was recommended with learning Python 3. Although Python 2.7 is still widely used, the adoption of Python 3 is increasing and will be more likely to be used in the future! I started learning Python through 'Learn Python the Hard Way' by Zed Shaw and the most up to date version was using Python 3.

### Q2. Which Python Version Installed   

In the Terminal:

`python3 --version`

>> Python 3.7.0
